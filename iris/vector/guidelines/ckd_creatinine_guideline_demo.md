# Clinical Guideline (Demo)
## Management of Rising Serum Creatinine in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

> **DISCLAIMER**  
> This document is a **synthetic guideline created for demonstration and educational purposes only**.  
> It is **not a real clinical guideline** and must **not** be used for real clinical decision-making.

## 1. Scope and Purpose

This guideline provides **general recommendations** for the follow-up of patients with **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** who present with a **rising serum creatinine level**.

The goal is to:
- Support clinical reasoning
- Encourage timely follow-up actions
- Reduce the risk of preventable kidney function deterioration

This guideline is intended for **clinical decision support systems**, not as a substitute for clinician judgment.

---

## 2. Target Population

Adult patients who meet **all** of the following criteria:

- Known diagnosis of **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** (any stage)
- At least one **serum creatinine result above the normal reference range**
- Availability of **previous creatinine measurements** for trend evaluation

---

## 3. Key Definitions

### Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)
A long-term condition characterized by a **persistent reduction in kidney function**, typically defined by:
- Reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and/or
- Structural or functional kidney abnormalities lasting more than 3 months

### Rising Creatinine
A **progressive increase** in serum creatinine values over time, particularly when:
- The increase is sustained across multiple measurements, or
- The relative increase exceeds **30% from baseline**

---

## 4. Risk Factors for Worsening Renal Function

The following factors are associated with a higher risk of renal function deterioration:

- Pre-existing CKD (especially stage 3 or higher)
- Advanced age (≥65 years)
- Dehydration or volume depletion
- Exposure to **nephrotoxic medications**, including:
  - Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
  - Certain antibiotics
  - Radiographic contrast agents
- Acute illness or infection

---

## 5. Clinical Interpretation of Findings

When evaluating a patient with CKD and elevated creatinine, clinicians should consider:

- **Trend over time**, not a single isolated value
- Recent changes in medication
- Presence of reversible factors (e.g., dehydration, drug exposure)
- Clinical stability of the patient

A single abnormal value may be less significant than a **consistent upward trend**.

---

## 6. Recommended Follow-up Actions

For patients with CKD and a rising creatinine trend, the following actions are commonly recommended:

1. **Repeat serum creatinine testing**
   - Typically within **7–14 days**
   - Sooner if the increase is rapid or clinically concerning

2. **Review current medications**
   - Identify and reconsider potentially nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., NSAIDs)
   - Assess recent medication changes

3. **Assess contributing factors**
   - Hydration status
   - Recent illness or procedures

4. **Monitor renal function closely**
   - Continue periodic laboratory monitoring
   - Adjust follow-up frequency based on risk level

These actions should be adapted to the individual patient context.

---

## 7. Risk Stratification (Simplified)

| Risk Level | Typical Characteristics |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Low | Mild elevation, stable trend, no high-risk factors |
| Moderate | Rising trend, CKD present, possible reversible factors |
| High | Rapid increase, advanced CKD, multiple risk factors |

Risk stratification supports prioritization but does **not** replace clinical judgment.

---

## 8. Role of Clinical Decision Support Systems

Clinical decision support systems may assist by:
- Detecting abnormal trends automatically
- Highlighting relevant risk factors
- Suggesting follow-up actions based on guidelines
- Providing **explainable reasoning** for recommendations

Such systems should always operate in a **supportive, non-autonomous** role.

---

## 9. Summary

- Rising creatinine in CKD patients requires **contextual evaluation**
- Medication review and follow-up testing are key first steps
- Early detection of deterioration may prevent irreversible damage
- Decision support tools can enhance safety when used responsibly
